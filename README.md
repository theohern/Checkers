# Checkers bots based on the Deep-Q learning algorithm

This study were part of the course NIE-MVI : "Computational Intelligence Methods" in the Technical University of Prague. 

The question I wanted to study is : "What is the most effective way of training a
reinforcement learning model with the Deep Q learning algorithm ?"

All the study is detailed in a pdf on the repository named $report.pdf$

## files

- $checkers.py$ is an implementations of the game of checkers
- $training.py$ is training the different models and save them into .keras files
- $compare.py$ is comparing the different bots created. 

for any improvement or use of my code, please contact me.
